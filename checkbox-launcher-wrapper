# This wrapper, which is installed as $SNAP_APP_PATH/bin/checkbox-launcher
# (taking over $SNAP_APP_PATH/usr/bin/checkbox-launcher in priority) serves
# two purposes:
# - It sets a PROVIDERPATH that plainbox can find bundled providers:
#   each provider is installed to /providers/$name, they are listed
#   in a typical :-separated PATH-like variable.
# This is largely tracked as https://bugs.launchpad.net/plainbox/+bug/1473939
export PROVIDERPATH="$SNAP_APP_PATH/providers/plainbox-provider-snappy:$SNAP_APP_PATH/providers/plainbox-provider-snappy-resource"
export PATH="$PATH:$SNAP_APP_PATH/usr/sbin"
# - It works around a bug in snapcraft which causes scripts to refer
#   to the wrong (outside, not bundled) interpreter.
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapcraft/+bug/1486659
# NOTE: Here python3 is already the one from the snap, because we are running
# in altered environment and PATH is set accordingly.
