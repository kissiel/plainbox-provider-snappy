_summary: Check number of detected I2C bus
_purpose:
 Verify if number of detected I2C bus is as expected
_steps:
 1. This task is fully automatic, when expected i2c bus number($I2C_BUS_NUMBER)
    is set, this job will verify if detected number of i2c bus is as expected.
 2. If expected i2c bus number is not set, this job will pass if system
    detected there's at least one i2c bus.
command:
 if [ -z ${I2C_BUS_NUMBER+x} ]; then
     i2c_driver_test bus
 else
     i2c_driver_test bus -b $I2C_BUS_NUMBER
